\begin{abstract}
Right-to-work laws weaken unions but their effects on wage levels and inequality are uncertain. 
I estimate how adoptions of right-to-work statutes in five U.S. states from 2003–2019 affected unionization and the wage distribution. 
Using IPUMS-CPS microdata, modern difference-in-differences estimators, and RIF regressions, I find that right-to-work laws reduce union membership and coverage by about 1.5 percentage points but generate modest wage declines, about one percent or less across most of the distribution, with little change in standard inequality measures. 
The results suggest that right-to-work laws mainly lower overall pay rather than reshape the wage structure.
